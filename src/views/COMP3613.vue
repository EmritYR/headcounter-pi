        <h2 class="display-1">Headcounter Project Overview</h2>
        <hr />
        <p class="body-1">
          The Attendance Tracker, given name as &#39;HeadCounter&#39;, basically
          works by using a Raspberry Pi to allow scanning of Student ID Card
          which has a built in RFID chip in it to log attendance. We chose this
          because we saw the need for it at UWIâ€™s Computer Labs and classes,
          where upon entry you would need to manually sign a register.
          Developing such an application would eliminate inefficiencies in
          attendance recording.

        <h2 class="title">Problem Statement</h2>
        <p class="body-1">
          At classes, students manually sign an attendance sheet when they enter
          a classroom. They are required to manually write their name and
          student ID. The current manual procedure is very inefficient due to
          the possibility of there being a line backup that might disrupt the
          students that are in a class.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h2 class="title">Proposed Solution</h2>
        <p class="body-1">
          A system must be developed comprising of the Raspberry Pi and RFID
          components to allow automated logging of attendance with the use of
          student ID cards. This system would also provide a way of viewing the
          attendance records for a particular class.

        <ul class="body-1">
          <li>
            -The student should be able to scan their student ID card to record
            attendance in any class.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Lecturers/ Tutors should be able to start and stop the scanning
            ability for a class at any time.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Lectures should be able to create classes, which include all
            students who are enrolled in that class.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Lecturers should be able to view the attendance records for their
            classes.
          </li>
          <li>
            - Lectures should be able to view missing students from specified
            class attendance record.
